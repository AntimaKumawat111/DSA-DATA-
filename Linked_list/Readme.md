# Linked List Operations

This project contains various C programs that perform different operations on linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.

## Files

- `circuler Linked list `: Operations on circular linked lists.
- `deletion At First In Linked List`: Delete the first node in a singly linked list.
- `deletion At Last`: Delete the last node in a singly linked list.
- `deletion In Between In Linked List`: Delete a node in between in a singly linked list.
- `deletion in given index`: Delete a node at a given index in a singly linked list.
- `doubly linked list`: Operations on doubly linked lists.

- `insertion After A node`: Insert a node after a given node in a singly linked list.
- `insertion At First In Linked List`: Insert a node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
- `insertion At Last `: Insert a node at the end of a singly linked list.
- `insertion In Between In Linked list`: Insert a node in between in a singly linked list (filename incomplete, needs clarification).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide implementations for various linked list operations in C. It serves as a reference for understanding linked list manipulation, including insertion, deletion, and traversal in different types of linked lists.

## Future Implementations

We plan to add more implementations of the queue data structure using different approaches and languages.
