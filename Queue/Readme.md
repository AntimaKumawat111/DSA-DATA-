# Queue Implementations

This directory contains various implementations of the queue data structure. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.

## Current Implementations

### Implementing Queue Using Array

- **File:** `implementing_queue_using_array.c`
- **Description:** This file contains a C program that demonstrates how to implement a queue using a fixed-size array.
 
- **File:** `enqueue_operation.c`
- **Description:** This file contains a C program that demonstrates how to do enqueue an element from the  queue .

- **File:** `dequeue_operation.c`
- **Description:** This file contains a C program that demonstrates how to do dequeue an element from the queue .


### Implementing Queue Using linked list
- **File:** `implementing_queue_using_linked_list.c`

## Future Implementations

We plan to add more implementations of the queue data structure using different approaches and languages.
